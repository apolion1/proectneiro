        "На уровне 95% доверительной вероятности нулевая гипотеза об отсутствии связи отклоняется (p-value = 0.0, что меньше, чем 0.05). Следовательно, связь между вовлеченностью в контент (видео) и категорией видео есть. Однако, поскольку процент ненаполненных ячеек превышает допустимое пороговое значение (20%) и составляет 84.264%, доверять полученным результатам критерия Хи-квадрат нельзя. В таком случае мы можем проанализировать и проинтерпретировать статистически значимые остатки критерия Хи-квадрат.\n",

        "Исходя из рассчитанного значения Хи-квадрат и p-value, можно сделать вывод, что есть статистически значимая связь между вовлеченностью в контент и категорией видео в генеральной совокупности. Таким образом, нулевая гипотеза отвергается, а альтернативная гипотеза подтверждается. Значение Хи-квадрат показывает, что различия между ожидаемыми и фактическими значениями частот значительны. Результаты Pearson's residual показывают, какие ячейки таблицы имеют наибольшее отклонение от ожидаемых значений. Например, категории Gaming и высокая вовлеченность имеют наибольшее положительное отклонение. С другой стороны, категории People & Blogs и низкая вовлеченность имеют наибольшее отрицательное отклонение, что может указывать на то, что видео в этой категории чаще вызывают высокую вовлеченность зрителей. В целом, результаты анализа позволяют сделать вывод о наличии связи между вовлеченностью в контент и категорией видео в генеральной совокупности."
